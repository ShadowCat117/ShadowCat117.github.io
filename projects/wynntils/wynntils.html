        <h1>Wynntils</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p> Wynntils is a Minecraft mod using Architectury to support Fabric and NeoForge, currently supporting 1.21. It is a rewrite (originally codenamed Artemis) of the original Wynntils mod, now known as Wynntils Legacy. I started out porting a feature from the original mod that was yet to be added and eventually added more over time to the point where I was asked to join the official development team. </p>
            <p> The mod was originally released in an alpha state with many features missing from the original but a lot of the framework existed for them to be added. Over time, many of these features were ported from different contributors and also some new features not present in the original were added. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-one">Waypoint Manager</h3>
                <p> This feature added a custom screen to allow users to easily view all of their custom waypoints and edit/delete them. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-two">Seaskipper Map</h3>
                <p> The Seaskipper Map screen replaces the default container screen with an overhead map view of the Wynncraft world with boxes around the available destinations the Seaskipper can take you to. </p>
                <p> You can use the options at the bottom of the screen to purchase a boat, toggle the borders, show unavailable destinations and draw lines along routes. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-three">Seaskipper Departure Board</h3>
                <p> The Seaskipper Departure Board is an alternative version of the Seaskipper Map screen that instead uses a list of the available destinations on the left side of the screen and those are used to select the destination instead. </p>
                <p> The alternative screen was still available as an option in the mod config until the screens were merged into one at a later date. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-four">Emerald Pouch Fill Arc</h3>
                <p> Emerald Pouches are in-game items that allow you to store emeralds in a single slot up to a certain amount, with the higher tiers increasing their capacity. </p>
                <p> This feature draws an arc around the item to show how full it is, also going from green to red in the process. </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1549"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

                <h3 id="feature-five">Guild Name and Rank in Content Book</h3>
                <p> This feature simply adds the rank for your current guild as well as the name of that guild to the book. It gets the information from reading the <q>lore</q> of an item in the compass menu which is read each time the player logs in to the server. </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1652"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

                <h3 id="feature-six">Custom Bank Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
                <p> Personal Storage Containers such as banks contain quick jump buttons to quickly navigate through the pages. By default these are set to 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 but this feature allows you to set custom ones. </p>
                <p> As we cannot directly modify which pages they jump to, the feature instead uses a combination of the vanilla jump buttons and the next/previous page buttons to get to the desired page. </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1670"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

                <h3 id="feature-seven">Scrolling Support for Bookshelf</h3>
                <p> A new update to the server added a new personal storage type so it was added to the scrollable list </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1734"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
                <h3 id="feature-eight">Feature Eight - Custom Bookshelf & Misc. Bucket Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
                <p> Two other personal storage containers that can have the quick jump buttons were the bookshelf and misc bucket. This feature does change the way you choose the destinations by making a list of 6 values, rather than 6 individual configs. </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1754"><u>here</u></a>. </p> <video controls>

                <h3 id="feature-nine">Custom Block Bank Quick Jump Buttons</h3>
                <p> The final personal storage container is the block bank, it works slightly different to the others by having a personal and island storage mode which currently is not fully supported as we have no method to detect current island but hopefully in the future it can be improved. </p>
                <p> The pull request for the feature is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/Wynntils/Wynntils/pull/1788"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
                <h3 id="feature-ten">Gavellian and Wynnic Transcription</h3>
                <p> Ancient Wynnic and High Gavellian are two languages used throughout the game. This feature transcribes the languages back into plain English characters. </p>
                <p> It also adds the ability for the user to send messages in these languages by surrounding their text in brackets or by using the buttons added to the chat screen to select language. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-eleven">Export Waypoints</h3>
                <p> Since you can import waypoints, it made sense for there to be an export option too. So this feature allows you to export all of your waypoints for them to be easily shared with others. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-twelve">Transcription Tooltips</h3>
                <p> This adds the ability to see transcriptions in a tooltip by hovering the text. If the option is disabled, a tooltip will still be shown but instead of showing the transcribed text it will show the original. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-thirteen">Armour and Accessory durability functions</h3>
                <p> In the game, you can craft armour and accessories and these will have durability, unlike regular items. But, you have to hover over them in your inventory to be able to see what their durability values are so this adds functions to see them more easily. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-fourteen">Custom Bank Page Names</h3>
                <p> This feature allows you to give custom names for the pages in your personal storage containers. </p>
                <p> It also hooks into the quick jumps feature by displaying the name of the page on the quick jump button. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-fifteen">Per Character Guild Contribution</h3>
                <p> You can contribute a certain percentage of your XP gained to your guild if you choose to do so, but the set value applies globally to all of your characters. </p>
                <p> This feature allows you to set it per character, so when you run the contribution command once, every time you load that character the command will automatically run with the saved amount. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-eighteen">Highlight Duplicate Cosmetics</h3>
                <p> For my next addition I added the ability to see duplicate cosmetics in the scrap menu. </p>
                <p> On Wynncraft you can get cosmetic items in crates, however they are not unique and you can get multiple of the same cosmetic. To account for this, you can scrap 5 of the same rarity cosmetics in exchange for 1 cosmetic of a higher rarity. </p>
                <p> Since some people only like to scrap cosmetics they have more than 1 of, this feature allows you to see if you have any duplicates of a cosmetic by hovering it, or selecting it to be scrapped. Hovering it will show duplicates in a blue ring and selected cosmetic duplicates in an orange ring. However the user can change the logic in the config to only highlight hovered or selected duplicates but the default is both. </p>
                <p> This feature was originally from the legacy version of the mod, however it only had support for hovering cosmetics, I believe this is an improvement as not all cosmetics are displayed at once so this allows you to see duplicates on all pages. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-nineteen">Support 2.0.4 Banks</h3>
                <p> The server announced a new update, 2.0.4, and with it came some changes to the way banks worked, so as I had done some features relating to the banks I decided to add support for them. </p>
                <p> The changes split the regular bank into two types, account and character. Previously, only account existed where all your items in the bank were accessible by all characters, but now there would be a bank for your account and a bank for each character. </p>
                <p> To accomodate for the changes, it was mostly editing regex patterns to read the new bank labels and modifying previous bank features to support the new character banks. There is a seperate set of quick jump destinations for account and character and then account and each character can have a unique set of custom names. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-twenty">Waypoint Manager Redesign</h3>
                <p> As I had gotten a lot more familiar with working on the mod, I decided to revisit some of my previous additions starting with my very first one, the waypoint manager. </p>
                <p> When I first ported it originally, I knew it wasn't matching the original perfectly, as I didn't have support for filtering by icons or importing and exporting waypoints. Since then, an import button was added by another contributor and I added an export button. But one of the things I wanted to include in this redesign was the icon filtering. </p>
                <p> The redesign includes scrolling by 1 waypoint at a time instead of displaying a full page and scrolling past that page so it appears much smoother, the ability to select waypoints for better exporting and deleting, sorting waypoints by icon, name and coordinates as well as the ability to filter waypoints by name or icon. Name filtering is simply using a text input and looking for matching names. </p>
                <p> The icon filtering takes a different approach from the legacy implementation, it instead uses a seperate screen displaying all used icons which can be toggled by clicking them. The reason for this more advanced system was due to a new system coming soon to the mod which would allow for custom icons and therefore a better system was needed for displaying many icons. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-twenty-one">Center Guild Map</h3>
                <p> Something simple I'd seen requested a lot was the ability to center the guild map when you are outside of the main area since unlike the main map, the guild map is only relevant for the main areas as that's where the territores are. </p>
                <p> This was a rather simple feature to add, simply defining bounds for what classed as inside the area and simply checking the player position. </p>
                <p> The border shown in the video is simply for display purposes and does not appear in the final feature. </p>

                <p> Another simple feature that I saw requested was being able to set markers for custom waypoint from the waypoint manager. </p>
                <p> It allows this via two methods, either middle clicking a poi to add and right clicking to remove, or selecting pois and then clicking the set/remove markers buttons to add or remove markers at all of the selected pois. </p>

                <p> After adding the ability to center the guild map when outside of the main map region, a similar feature was to center the main map when outside of a mapped area and also to hide the minimap when in an unmapped area. </p>
                <p> A check is made to see if there are any map files in a certain radius around the player, and if there are not then it will count you as in an unmapped area. </p>
                <p> Opening the map when in an unmapped area will center the map on the main area. And if the setting is enabled, the minimap will not render when in an unmapped area. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-twenty-four">Item Sharing GUI</h3>
                <p> As another developer was reworking the feature that allowed you to share items in chat, one thing they wanted to add but didn't have the time to work on was a new GUI for sharing items, instead of a prompt in chat. </p>
                <p> The original chat prompt still exists as a config option, but this GUI is the default, allowing you to see a preview of the item, save to your item record and quick share options for party and guild. This is also where you can edit options to show crafted item names, or to use extended encoding. </p>

                <p> Another part to the rework of sharing items was the ability to save certain items for quick access so you wouldn't have to return to your in-game bank to share the item. </p>
                <p> The item record also allows players to sort their saved items into different categories, and allow items to be in various different categories. </p>

                <p> With this redesign, I also made the departure board scrollable as if any new destinations were to be added, the old screen would have not supported that. </p>

                <p> One such feature was an overlay to display active bombs gathered from the bomb bell feature. The overlay allows you to choose which bombs you want to see, so if you do not want to see combat XP bombs, you can hide those from the overlay. </p>

                <p> Since the item filter system was made, there have been complaints about it being too complicated for users to use so I decided to create a GUI that would hopefully make the system a lot more accessible to users. </p>
                <p> Boolean filters have a true/false checkbox. And strings and numeric filters get a text box. Some filters only have a few valid inputs, so the GUI will only show those valid inputs with checkboxes to select the desired filters. </p>
                <p> You can also save presets so if you want to search for a specific query multiple times, it's easier to do so. </p>

                <p> The feature will start a timer once it detects you are in a raid, until you start the 1st challenge this goes towards the intermission timer. After completing the challenge, the time will then count towards intermission. This will repeat for challenge 2 and 3, then the boss timer starts when the boss fight begins and once defeated the timer will end and your times will be sent to chat. </p>

                <p> One feature the redesign of the settings screen had was better scrolling, however I decided to improve it further and make it smooth scrolling instead of 1. This was a major improvement to the scrolling of the settings screen, as prior to this the scroll bar was not synced to mouse movement correctly and wasn't actually scrolling, it was just displaying pages of 13 rows at a time. <q>row</q> at a time. </p>

                <p> I completely redesigned the overlay selection screen, now featuring a search bar and category tags to show built in vs custom ones. It also persists your scroll position between edits so you don't have to keep scrolling back down after editing each overlay. </p>
                <p> Another new addition is the ability to edit the configs for each overlay directly, without having to go to the settings screen to do it. You can also preview the overlay by itself or show other overlays too. </p>
                <p> The management screen wasn't changed much, the position of the buttons was changed from the center of the screen to the bottom with a button to switch between displaying them at the bottom and the top. There is also a new option to show only the selected overlay or to show all. </p>
                <p> The main change was being able to see the real overlay whilst moving and resizing it, instead of just seeing the green box with the overlay name and having to go into test mode to see how it actually looked. </p>

                <p> I made some changes to the existing profession highlight feature for the way they interact with crafting stations. As crafting stations only use 1 type of profession each, I made the feature work as a toggle when using these stations rather than cycling through all profession types like in other containers. </p>

                <p> As we are adding new leaderboard badges soon, increasing the amount from 13 to 33, I thought it would be smart to set a cap on how many are displayed at once, though unlikely that a player would have 33 it would not look good in-game. </p>

                <h3 id="feature-fourty-five">Settings Screen Redesign</h3>
                <p> As I got some improved textures for the settings screen I was able to finish the settings screen redesign. </p>
                <p> It features the ability to filter visible settings by category to help narrow down what setting you want or to make it easier to go through each setting. </p>
                <p> The search bar was also improved, now it displays the settings for current selected category first, followed by any settings matching the search query from other categories. It also adds a number in square brackets after the feature name to show how many configs match the current query. Upon selecting a feature, the configs on the right will automatically scroll down to make the first config matching the search query be visible. </p>
                <p> The other improvements are a checkbox next to each feature to quickly enable/disable a feature without having to click it and then press the button on the right page. And also, the ability to import/export configs, you can either do this for currently selected feature or for all settings. </p>

                <p> Wynncraft released the beta for their new update 2.1 and we began fixing up the mod to support it so that it would be ready for when the full update dropped. </p>
                <p> One feature that required a lot of changes were my custom bank page names and quick jumps features. As the banks no longer display the page number at the top and the quick jumps are now handled by pressing the 1-9 keys whilst hovering a next/previous button. </p>
                <p> In order to support the new banks, I reworked the feature to add an extra panel to the left side of the banks, this would display the page name and also the quick jump buttons. </p>
                <p> Custom names work the same as before for the most part, but quick jumps have been completely changed. They are no longer 6 set destinations that can be customised, now all destinations are available and you can jump to any page you desire. </p>

                <p> A new feature of 2.1 was aspects, which are class specific items that give buffs to certain abilities. </p>
                <p> What this feature does, is allow the mod to identify if an item is an aspect and if so, highlight it based on the rarity and add an annotation for what class it is used on. The annotation colour also changes based on the tier of the aspect. </p>

                <p> ModMenu is a mod for Fabric that allows you to edit configs for mods. Many mods use this as they do not have configs of their own but since we have our own, this simply adds support for ModMenu to open our settings screen from the list of installed mods. This also allows users to edit their settings whilst not logged in to Wynncraft which is something that is required by default. </p>
                <p> As for NeoForge, it has a built in mod list where you can configure settings so I just had to set our settings screen in NeoForge to allow it to access it. </p>
