         <h1>Maze Bounce</h1>
         <div class="content">
            <p>It's a mobile game built in Unity
               that involves players placing corners in randomly
               generated mazes of different sizes to launch a ball through
               the maze to reach the end.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/MazeBounce.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the first level of the game.">
            <p>The game contains 10,000 randomly generated levels for each of the 6
               difficulties. Each difficulty is just a name for the size of the maze,
               so beginnger is 11x11, easy is 13x13 up to insane which is 19x19. The
               mazes are randomly generated via a seed so they will always be the same
               for each level.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/MazeBounceLevels.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the final page of beginner levels, displaying up to level 10,000.">
            <p>
               There is also a daily level, which is the largest at 21x21 and there
               is one available every day, resetting at midnight UTC. The daily maze
               is the same for everyone every day.
            </p>

            <p>
               The game currently contains over 4,000 different customisation options,
               these are mostly the same patterns with different colour schemes using
               Unity's shader system. These are available for the ball, the background,
               the walls of the maze and the placeable corners. Most patterns are static,
               but there are a few for each that are animated.
            </p>
            <p>
               The game uses 16 different colours, so there are
               16 of each customisation option just using the solid colour, then all
               other patterns use a combination of those 16, some have unique primary
               and secondary combinations and some allow for them to be swapped.
            </p>
            <p>
               For example, the checkered pattern uses a similar amount of each colour
               so it only allows for white and red to be used once. But a pattern
               where one colour is used more than the other will also allow for red and
               white to be used.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/MazeBounceCustomisation.jpg" alt="A screenshot of some of the customisation options available for corners.">
            <p>
               There is room for many more customisation options, as currently you can
               earn 700,000 tokens for completing every level and if you unlock each 
               pattern via the random unlock rather than directing unlocking, you will
               still have just under 500,000 left. 
            </p>

            <p>
               The game features a few achievements using Google Play Games. They are all
               fairly simple, being to just complete a certain amount of levels, but there
               is one hidden achievement that is not unlocked from regular gameplay.

            <p>
               The game also makes use of Unity IAP, Unity Cloud Save and Google AdMob for
               different functionality. Unity IAP allows for in-app purchases to be made.
               Unity Cloud Save allows for players data to be stored on the cloud in case
               they swap device or reinstall the game. And Google AdMob is used for displaying
               both rewarded and interstitial ads to the player.

               I started out by planning what features I wanted to include
               in the game. At first they were just the basics of generating
               mazes, placing corners so that a ball could be launched through
               and bounce on the corners to reach the end and customisation options
               for the ball, background, corners and the walls of the maze.
            </p>
            <p>
               As development continued I thought of new ideas such as having different
               sized mazes for different difficulties, so starting out at 11x11 and
               going up to 19x19. Also including a daily level which would be 21x21.
               And finally, a challenge difficulty, which was only 13x13 but all of the
               walls were invisible, so you had to use trial and error to find the end.
            </p>
            <p>
               I still have a few more ideas on features I could implement, however they
               would take a lot of time to implement and I think they'll only be worth
               adding if the game actually has any players so I will wait and see how
               it does before starting work on them.
