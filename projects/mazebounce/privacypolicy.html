         <h1>Maze Bounce Privacy Policy</h1>
         <h2>Last updated: 4th May 2023</h2>
         <div class="content">
            <p>This page will explain how the game Maze Bounce collects, stores and uses the
               information collected from you playing the game.
            </p>
            <p>No personal information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers etc are
               stored by Maze Bounce. 
            </p>
            <p>Any non personal information stored is simply just to allow the game to be played
               such as your progress made in the game.
            </p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>Maze Bounce uses your Google Play Games profile as a method to
               identify users uniquely and link that to a Unity player ID so
               your save data can be saved to and loaded from the cloud.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/CloudProfile.png" alt="A screenshot of the information shown on Unity Cloud Save for a player.">
            <p>This is the only data shown for a created profile, your date and time of last login,
               the date and time when your profile was created and what your profile is linked to
               for authentication, in this case only Google Play Games is an option.
            </p>
            <p>A ID is also generated to uniquely identify your account, so that if you wish
               for your save data to be deleted, or if you require support with your cloud
               data, then that can be used to find your cloud save. This ID is randomly generated
               and cannot be used to find any information about your Google Play Games profile.
            </p>
            <p>
               If you would like your profile to be deleted, please send an email to
               <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a>
               and be sure to include your player ID, which can be located in the settings menu
               of the game if you are logged in.
            </p>
            <p>Do note that if you log back in to the app with the same Google Play
               Games profile after having your data deleted, a new ID will be generated
               with no cloud save data.
            </p>
            <h3>Cloud Save</h3>
            <p>The data stored on the cloud is primarily composed of 0's and 1's
               to store the data on what levels you have completed and what customisation
               you have unlocked. No personal information is collected.
            </p>
            <p>If you do wish to receive your cloud save data then please send an email
               with your ID to <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a>.
               But be aware that this data will likely not mean anything to you, as it is
               only meant for the app to read.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/CloudSave.png" alt="A screenshot of some information stored for a Cloud Save.">
            <p>This is a section of some of the data stored on the cloud. The left text is the
               key to identify what data is stored. Next is the data stored. And the two dates
               are for when data was first saved to that key, and the second date is when it was
               last modified.
            </p>
            <p>Your cloud save data will be saved permenantly, even after uninstalling the game
               so if you want the data to be deleted after uninstalling then please send an email
               to <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a>
               and include your player ID.
            </p>
            <h3>Advertising</h3>
            <p>Maze Bounce uses Google AdMob to display advertisements to you in the form
               of both interstitial and rewarded ads.
            </p>
            <p>This means that you can control if you want targeted ads or not via
               your phones settings. This should be located in Settings > Google >
               Ads.
            </p>
            <p>From here you may have different options, if you are only shown
               "Get new advertising ID" then you already have targeted ads disabled.
               If you see "Reset advertising ID" and "Delete advertising ID", then
               choosing reset advertising ID will give you less relevant ads for a
               time whilst data is collected to find what ads will be relevant.
               Deleting your advertising ID will disable targeted ads.
            </p>
            <p>Advertisements in Maze Bounce will display ads based on whether or
               not you have an advertising ID.
            </p>
            <h3>Services Used</h3>
