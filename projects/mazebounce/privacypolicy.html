        <h1>Maze Bounce Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Last updated: 5th May 2023</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>This page will explain how the game Maze Bounce collects, stores and uses the information collected from you playing the game. </p>
            <p>The only personal information collected via Maze Bounce is your date of birth which you will have to enter on your first launch of the app, this is only stored locally on your device and is not shared anywhere. The reason why the app requires your date of birth is to determine your age to know whether or not certain ads can be displayed to you in the app. </p>
            <p>Clearing your local data of the app or uninstalling it will clear this data from your device and if you launch the app again you will have to re enter the information. </p>
            <p>Any non personal information stored is simply just to allow the game to be played such as your progress made in the game. </p>
            <h3>Authentication</h3>
            <p>Maze Bounce uses your Google Play Games profile as a method to identify users uniquely and link that to a Unity player ID so your save data can be saved to and loaded from the cloud. </p> <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/CloudProfile.png" alt="A screenshot of the information shown on Unity Cloud Save for a player.">
            <p>This is the only data shown for a created profile, your date and time of last login, the date and time when your profile was created and what your profile is linked to for authentication, in this case only Google Play Games is an option. </p>
            <p>A ID is also generated to uniquely identify your account, so that if you wish for your save data to be deleted, or if you require support with your cloud data, then that can be used to find your cloud save. This ID is randomly generated and cannot be used to find any information about your Google Play Games profile. </p>
            <p> If you would like your profile to be deleted, please send an email to <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a> and be sure to include your player ID, which can be located in the settings menu of the game if you are logged in. </p>
            <p>Do note that if you log back in to the app with the same Google Play Games profile after having your data deleted, a new ID will be generated with no cloud save data. </p>
            <h3>Cloud Save</h3>
            <p>The data stored on the cloud is primarily composed of 0's and 1's to store the data on what levels you have completed and what customisation you have unlocked. No personal information is collected. </p>
            <p>If you do wish to receive your cloud save data then please send an email with your ID to <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a>. But be aware that this data will likely not mean anything to you, as it is only meant for the app to read. </p> <img src="/Resources/MazeBounce/CloudSave.png" alt="A screenshot of some information stored for a Cloud Save.">
            <p>This is a section of some of the data stored on the cloud. The left text is the key to identify what data is stored. Next is the data stored. And the two dates are for when data was first saved to that key, and the second date is when it was last modified. </p>
            <p>Your cloud save data will be saved permenantly, even after uninstalling the game so if you want the data to be deleted after uninstalling then please send an email to <a href="mailto:help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com" style="color: #ccc; text-decoration: underline; font-size: inherit; padding: 0;">help.shadowcatgames@gmail.com</a> and include your player ID. </p>
            <h3>Advertising</h3>
            <p>Maze Bounce uses Google AdMob to display advertisements to you in the form of both interstitial and rewarded ads. </p>
            <p>This means that you can control if you want targeted ads or not via your phones settings. This should be located in Settings > Google > Ads. </p>
            <p>From here you may have different options, if you are only shown "Get new advertising ID" then you already have targeted ads disabled. If you see "Reset advertising ID" and "Delete advertising ID", then choosing reset advertising ID will give you less relevant ads for a time whilst data is collected to find what ads will be relevant. Deleting your advertising ID will disable targeted ads. </p>
            <p>Advertisements in Maze Bounce will display ads based on whether or not you have an advertising ID. </p>
            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>When the date of birth entered on the first launch of the app detects that the user is under the age of 18, the app will act under the assumption that the user is a child to cover all countries where the age definition for a child is different. </p>
            <p>All this changes in the app is the ads that are displayed will be set to have a maximum content rating of G (General Audiences). The date of birth is only stored locally and not shared anywhere even for adult users so there is no difference for children, this is only stored so that users do not have to enter it every time they launch the app. </p>
            <h3>Services Used</h3>
            <p>This is a list of services that Maze Bounce uses. They each have their own privacy policies which I would recommened reading if you want to know more about what data Maze Bounce sends to them:
