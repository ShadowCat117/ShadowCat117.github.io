            <p>This page contains all of the known issues for the game Maze Bounce as of the date above. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>On some devices, dragging a corner does not line up with touch input.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is purely visual and ending the drag action still places the corner on the position where the input stopped. </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sometimes the ball will go through walls/corners and/or escape the maze.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This may have been fixed as of version 1.0.4 but I'll leave it here just in case.</li>
                    <li>The game should detect if the ball escapes the mazes and stop movement automatically and whenever a wall is hit the movement will also be stopped automatically.</li>
                    <li>Whenever a wall is hit or the ball is detected as being outside the maze a check will occur to see if you have correctly placed all corners and if so a panel will appear to notify you of the issue and you will be given the choice to try the level again or to just complete it. You will also be able to choose if this panel should appear every time the issue happens or to just automatically complete the level.</li>
