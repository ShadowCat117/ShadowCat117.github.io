         <h1>Accessible Codenames</h1>
         <div class="content">
            <p>This was my final year project for my Software Engineering
               course at Swansea University. I recreated the board game
               Codenames as an Android application with a strong focus
               on accessibility.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/Codenames/Codenames.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the board of the game as shown in the app.">
            <p>Codenames is played with 2 teams of players, both having a
               minimum of 2 members. One member per team is assigned
               the role of 'spymaster' whilst every other member is simply
               just a regular player.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/Codenames/CodenamesTeamSetup.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the scene for setting up teams for the game.">
            <p>Once the teams have been setup and you start the game,
               you will be presented with the board which contains 25
               unique words all assigned to one of 4 colours. By default
               these are blue for team A, red for team B, a light green for
               neutral and black for the bomb word.
            </p>
            <p>To play the game, the starting teams spymaster must find a
               word that links to as many of the words coloured with their
               teams colour. For example, if their team has the words "file"
               and "root" you could give the hint "directory" as that relates
               to both words. To indiciate to your team how many words they
               have to choose, you must also give a number along with the
               word, in this case 2.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/Codenames/CodenamesGuess.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the game in the guessing phase of the game.">
            <p>After a hint has been given, the other members of the team
               must select which words they think the hint relates to. They
               are allowed to guess 1 more than the number given, so if the
               hint relates to 2 words, 3 guesses can be made.
            </p>
            <p>However, you aren't allowed to freely guess as guessing a
               word belonging to the other team or a neutral word will end
               your teams turn early and clicking the bomb word will instantly
               end the game with your loss.
            </p>
            <p>After your team completes your turn, the opposing teams
               spymaster must now give a hint for their team and the cycle
               repeats until either the bomb word is clicked, or one team
               successfully clicks all of their words.
            </p>
            <p>The game features two ways to play, either as a replacement
               to the board game or you can play online with friends. If you
               choose to play locally then you can select team members to
               make it easier to remember whos team everyone is on, or
               you can play without setting up teams. You then pass the
               device around your group dependent on who the current game
               phase applies too.
            </p>
            <p>The online version of the game can be played on your own
               device and allows you to play with people not in the same
               room as you. The game still functions the same but now
               includes a chat option to communicate with team members.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/Codenames/CodenamesOnline.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the teams in an online match of the game.">
            <p>For the accessibility features in the game, I chose to go
               with Text-to-Speech and customising colours. The
               Text-to-Speech is triggered by performing a held press on
               an element that has text associated with it, so a button or
               just plain text for example. This will then read the text out
               to the user.
            </p>
            <p>As for customising colours, you have free control over the
               colour of 8 different categories in the app. These are:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Team A</li>
               <li>Team B</li>
               <li>Bomb Square</li>
               <li>Neutral Square</li>
               <li>Unmodified Square</li>
               <li>Application Background</li>
               <li>Menu Buttons</li>
               <li>Menu Text</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are 3 available slots to save different combinations
               of colours.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/Codenames/CodenamesColours.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the scene in the game that allows you to choose the colours of different elements of the game.">
            <p>I initially started by created designs for how each scene
               in the app would look and then I created that using XML in
               Android Studio. Afterwards I created basic code in Kotlin
               for navigating through the different scenes, testing that
               every piece of code I wrote worked as intended as I went.
            </p>
            <p>The server to connect the devices together for online play
               was written in JavaScript using the Node.js framework.
               Whilst is certainly has room for improvement, given that
               it was self taught due to JavaScript not being taught on my course
               at University I think it works very well.
            </p>
