    <p>
        This was my final year project for my Software Engineering degree at Swansea University. I recreated
        the board game <strong>Codenames</strong> as an Android application with a strong focus on accessibility,
        including text-to-speech support and fully customizable colours.
    </p>

    <p>
        Codenames is played with two teams, each containing at least two players. One player from each team
        becomes the spymaster while everyone else guesses based on hints provided.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game board contains 25 unique words assigned to four categories: Team A, Team B, neutral, and the
        bomb word. Spymasters provide a word and number as a hint to guide their team toward selecting linked
        words while avoiding opposing or bomb words.
    </p>

    <p>
        The app includes multiple playstyles: local pass-and-play or online multiplayer. Online play includes
        chat support, while local play allows assigning real players to teams for easier memory.
    </p>

    <p>
        Accessibility features include Text-to-Speech via long-pressing UI elements, and fully customizable
        colour settings across eight interface categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Team A</li>
        <li>Team B</li>
        <li>Bomb Square</li>
        <li>Neutral Square</li>
        <li>Unmodified Square</li>
        <li>Application Background</li>
        <li>Menu Buttons</li>
        <li>Menu Text</li>
    </ul>

    <img src="/Resources/Codenames/CodenamesColours.jpg" alt="Colour customization screen">

    <p>
        Users can save up to three colour configuration presets. Designs were created in XML layouts via
        Android Studio, with navigation and logic written in Kotlin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Online connectivity is powered by a custom Node.js server. While self-taught, the implementation
        successfully handles real-time communication for gameplay and chat.
