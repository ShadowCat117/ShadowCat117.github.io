            <p>The coursework for my University module, 'Introduction to
               Video Games Programming'. I took the game Pac-man, 
               recreated it in Unity with custom levels and characters.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChase.jpg" alt="A screenshot of one of the levels from the game.">
            <p>The game launches into a main menu where you can choose
               to play, view leaderboards, view achievements or exit. This
               menu is controlled via the keyboard only.
            </p>
            <p>The leaderboards are per level and sort by the highest
               any player has achieved and submitted. Any repeated name
               will overwrite the existing score of that name.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseLeaderboard.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the leaderboards for level one.">
            <p>The achievements are global and once they are unlocked
               they cannot be completed again, the stat they track just
               continues to increase. 
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseAchievements.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the achievements scene in the game.">
            <p>The game features 5 different characters which each have
               a different power up. There are also 3 different levels
               with different layouts.
            </p>
            <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseCharacters.jpg" alt="A screenshot of one of the character selection in the game.">
            <p>I started by looking at existing implementations of
               Pac-man in Unity as they would be a good guide for how
               to create certain parts of the game. After this I made
               the first level and worked on movement and then
               submitted the code for peer review as part of the module.
               After receiving feedback I made improvements before
               working on the rest of the game.
            </p>
            <p>As the game uses Unity it is written in C# and I made
               design patterns through such as the component and
               observer pattern.
            </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the game is 
               available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;"; href="https://github.com/JamieCallan117/MythChase"><u>here</u></a>.
