        Myth Chase was developed as coursework for the university module
        <strong>Introduction to Video Games Programming</strong>. The game is inspired by Pac-Man but
        features custom levels, characters, and expanded mechanics implemented in Unity.

        The game opens to a keyboard-controlled main menu where players can start the game, view
        achievements, check leaderboards, or exit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Leaderboards are level-specific and store the highest submitted score per player name, replacing
        previous entries from the same name.

        Achievements function globally and track progress continually even after completion.

        The game includes <strong>five playable characters</strong> each with a unique ability, and
        three levels with different maze layouts and gameplay patterns.

    <p>
        Development began by reviewing existing Unity Pac-Man implementations as references. Movement,
        level layout, and behaviour were built first and then refined following peer review.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game is written in C# and incorporates standard architectural principles such as the
        component and observer patterns.
