        <h1>Myth Chase</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The coursework for my University module, 'Introduction to Video Games Programming'. I took the game Pac-man, recreated it in Unity with custom levels and characters. </p> <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChase.jpg" alt="A screenshot of one of the levels from the game.">
            <p>The game launches into a main menu where you can choose to play, view leaderboards, view achievements or exit. This menu is controlled via the keyboard only. </p>
            <p>The leaderboards are per level and sort by the highest any player has achieved and submitted. Any repeated name will overwrite the existing score of that name. </p> <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseLeaderboard.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the leaderboards for level one.">
            <p>The achievements are global and once they are unlocked they cannot be completed again, the stat they track just continues to increase. </p> <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseAchievements.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the achievements scene in the game.">
            <p>The game features 5 different characters which each have a different power up. There are also 3 different levels with different layouts. </p> <img src="/Resources/MythChase/MythChaseCharacters.jpg" alt="A screenshot of one of the character selection in the game.">
            <p>I started by looking at existing implementations of Pac-man in Unity as they would be a good guide for how to create certain parts of the game. After this I made the first level and worked on movement and then submitted the code for peer review as part of the module. After receiving feedback I made improvements before working on the rest of the game. </p>
            <p>As the game uses Unity it is written in C# and I made design patterns through such as the component and observer pattern. </p>
            <p>The GitHub repository for the game is available <a style="margin-left: 0px;font-size: 20px;" ; href="https://github.com/ShadowCat117/MythChase"><u>here</u></a>. </p>
